    When you input a value (whether String, int, double, etc) and hit 'enter,'      a new-line character ('\n') will be appended to the end of your input.
     So, if you're entering an int, sc.nextInt() will only read the integer entered and leave the '\n' behind in the buffer. 
     So, the way to fix this is to add a sc.nextLine() that will read the leftover and throw it away. 
     
     Except nextChar(), we have all. nextBoolean(), nextByte();
     when we call this method, it pauses and waits for the user to enter a value and the entered value will be returnedby these methods
